# The Song My Computer Made

## Lyrics

You’ve been searching for a sign
That everything will be alright
But no matter what you find
Nothing seems to ease your mind

So you enter a dark place
A pace of panic and disgrace
You wish there was a better way
A way to ease the fear and pain

So you found yourself here
You found cigarettes and beer
You found a sometimes lover
Your sometimes lovers also here

And I am here too
Though I have few words for you
All that I can think to say
Is dance to the song my computer made

So you got your palms read
The lines on your hands clearly said
That you need to get over it
That you need to get over it

Now you wear gloves all the time
Because the lines on your hands lie
Next you’re gonna ask the stars
Next you’re gonna ask the 
sky
